Project Showcase: DLL Injection, IAT Hooking, and Socket Communication
The project simulates a secret cyber attack performed by a malware.
DLL Injection and IAT Hooking:
I've implemented DLL injection into target process, leveraging Windows API functions to seamlessly inject custom code. I further extended the project by performing Import Address Table (IAT) hooking, enabling interception and redirection of specific function calls within the target process.

Socket Communication Integration:
To facilitate communication, I integrated socket programming, enabling the injected code to establish a connection with a remote server. Upon successful hooking, the project initiated a socket connection, transmitting relevant data to the server.
